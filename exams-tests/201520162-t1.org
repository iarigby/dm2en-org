  1. Draw a simple 8 vertex graphs with the following degrees or prove
     that such a graph doesn't exist:
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment inparaenum
     1) 6, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1;
     2) 7, 7, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3;
     3) 7, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0.
     4) 6, 6, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3;
  2. Let $T=(\varphi,E,V)$ be a *tree* with $V=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ where
     $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $p=[\,]$ an empty list.  Find the vertex
     $v$ with $\deg(v) = 1$ and with the smallest value, write the
     value of the (unique) vertex adjacent to $v$ at the end of the
     list $p$ and delete $v$ from the graph. Repeat this procedure
     until there is only one vertex left in the graph!  The list $p$
     obtained at the end should be of length $n-1$ with $n$ as its
     last element - this is the Prüfer code of the tree graph $T$.
     Determine (and draw) the spanning tree with minimal weight (you
     can use Kruskal's algorithm) of the following graphs and find
     their Prüfer code:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment inparaenum
     1) 
	#+BEGIN_LaTeX
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\foreach \i 
	in {0,1,2}{
	\foreach[evaluate=\j as \ij using int(\j*3+\i+1)] \j 
	in {0,1,2}{ \draw (\i, \j) node[draw] (\ij) {\ij}; } };
	\draw 
	(3) edge[below] node{10} (2)
	(1) edge[left]  node{3}  (4)
	(4) edge[above] node{9}  (5)
	(2) edge[left]  node{3}  (5)
	(5) edge[above] node{8}  (6)
	(6) edge[right] node{9}  (3)
	(6) edge[right] node{4}  (9)
	(9) edge[above] node{5}  (8)
	(7) edge[left]  node{8}  (4)
	;
	\end{tikzpicture}
	#+END_LaTeX
     2) 
	#+BEGIN_LaTeX
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\foreach \i 
	in {0,1,2}{
	\foreach[evaluate=\j as \ij using int(\j*3+\i+1)] \j 
	in {0,1,2}{ \draw (\i, \j) node[draw] (\ij) {\ij}; } };
	\draw 
	(1) edge[below] node{1}  (2)
	(1) edge[left]  node{2}  (4)
	(6) edge[above] node{3}  (5)
	(2) edge[right] node{4}  (5)
	(2) edge[below] node{5}  (7)
	(6) edge[right] node{6}  (3)
	(6) edge[right] node{7}  (9)
	(9) edge[above] node{8}  (8)
	(7) edge[above] node{9}  (8)
	(2) edge[below] node{10}  (3)
	(5) edge[left]  node{11}  (8)
	(7) edge[left]  node{12}  (4)
	;
	\end{tikzpicture}
	#+END_LaTeX
     3) Then try to find the tree with Prüfer code \(p=[56456569]\)!

  3. Show that a graph is bipartite if and only if it contains only
     circles of even length.
  4. Consider the multiplicative groups $(\mathbb{Z}^*_{7},\cdot)$ and
     $(\mathbb{Z}^*_{14},\cdot)$.  What is their order? Are they
     cyclic?  If they are cyclic, find a generator! Are they
     isomorphic? If they are isomorphic find an isomorphism between
     them!
  5. Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a group, $e \in G$ its identity element and
     $f,g \in G$. Show that if $f^2 = e$, $g^6 = e$ and $fg = g^4f$,
     then $g^3 = e$ and $fg = gf$.
  6. In the dihedral group $D_n$ for $n=15$ and the elements of the
     group $g_1=\varepsilon^6 \circ \tau^3 \circ \varepsilon^5 \circ
     \tau^8 \circ \varepsilon^{13} \circ \tau^{21}$ and $g_2=\tau^2
     \circ \varepsilon^{44} \circ \tau$ answer the following
     questions:
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment inparaenum
     1) What is the order of $D_n$?
     2) Simplify $g_1$, $g_2$ and $g_1\circ g_2$.
     3) What are the sub\-group $\langle g_1 \rangle$, $\langle g_2
        \rangle$, $\langle g_1\circ g_2 \rangle$ and $\langle g_1, g_2
        \rangle$?
     4) What is the order of the elements $g_1$, $g_2$ and $g_1\circ
        g_2$?
