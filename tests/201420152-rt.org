  1. Draw a simple 8 vertex graphs with the following degrees or prove
     that such a graph doesn't exist:
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment inparaenum
     1) $6, 6, 6, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1$;
     2) $7, 6, 6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 0$;
     3) $6, 6, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1$;
     4) $6, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1$;
  2. Show, that there is a closed directed Euler walk in a directed
     graph if $d^-(v)=2=d^+(v)$ for every vertex $v$.
  3. Show that any tree with at least two vertices is bipartite.
  4. Let $n=14$. Show that $(\mathbb{Z}_{n}^*,\cdot)$ is a group where
     $\mathbb{Z}_{n}^*=\{\overline{k}\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}:(k,n)=1\}$ \ie
     the residue classes relative prime to $n$ with multiplication.
  5. Show that $c\mapsto
     (\begin{smallmatrix}1&c\\0&1\end{smallmatrix})$ is a homomorphism
     from $(\mathbb{R},+)$ to $(\{(\begin{smallmatrix} 1&c\\0&1
     \end{smallmatrix}):c\in\mathbb{R}\},\cdot)$.
  6. In the dihedral group $D_n$ for $n=18$ and the elements of the
     group $g_1=\tau \circ \varepsilon^4 \circ \tau^5$, $g_2=\tau^{25}
     \circ \varepsilon^{21}$ answer the following questions:
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment inparaenum
     1) What is the order of $D_n$?
     2) Simplify $g_1$, $g_2$ and $g_1\circ g_2$.
     3) What are the sub\-group generated by $g_1$, $g_2$ and
        $g_1\circ g_2$?

  #+LATEX: \begin{multicols}{2}
  1. Find the roots and their multiplicities using $\gcd(f,f')$ of
     $f=x^6-24x^4+32x^3+144x^2-384x+256 \in\C[x]$.
  2. Let $f=x^3 +x +2\in\Z_5[x]$.  Calculate the following polynomials
     in $\Z_5[x]/(f)$ (\ie $\bmod f$): $x^{-2}$ and $(x^4+4)$.
  3. Using the rational root test find the roots of $f=x^5 - 4x^4 -
     6x^3 + 16x^2 + 29x + 12$ and using the Schönemann-Eisenstein
     theorem prove that $g=6x^5 -24x^3 +18x^2 +15x 40$ is an
     irreducible polynomial in $\Q[x]$ and $\Z[x]$.
  4. Use Lagrange interpolation to find $f\in\Z_7[x]$ the polynomial
     for which $\hat{f}(1)=3$, $\hat{f}(3)=1$, and $\hat{f}(5)=6$.
  5. Construct a Huffman code with $r=2$ and $r=3$ for the following
     distribution: $0.50, 0.15, 0.15, 0.10, 0.06, 0.04$.  Calculate
     $\overline{\ell}$ and $H_r(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n)$.
  6. Find the error check matrix $H$ of the generator matrix $G$.  How
     many elements does the code have?  What is the code distance,
     error detection and correction capability of the code?  How would
     you encode the message $u=011$?  How would you decode the bit
     sequence $v=1101101$?
     \[ G=  \begin{pmatrix} 
     1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
     0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1
