* First sample test - Discrete mathematics 2.
  1. Draw a simple 7 vertex graphs with the following degrees or prove
     that such a graph doesn't exist:
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment inparaenum
     1) $6, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 2$;
     2) $6, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3$;
     3) $6, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 2$;
     4) $6, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 0$.
  2. Six contestants are competing in a tournament.  Prove that at
     any moment there are three players who all played against each
     other, or three players who didn't play with the other two.
  3. Show, that each connected graph contains a walk which contains
     each edge exactly twice.  Is it a closed walk?
  4. Show that $(E,\cdot)$ is a group where
     $E=\cup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\{x\in\mathbb{C}:x^n=1\}$ and the
     operation is the usual multiplication defined on complex numbers.
  5. Show that if the inverse of every element in a group is the
     element itself, then the group is commutative.
  6. Show that $\varphi$ is a homo\-morphism from $(G,\cdot)$ to
     $(G',*)$ where $G&=\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ with the usual
     multiplication defined on the real numbers and
     $G'&=\left\{(\begin{smallmatrix}a & a \\ a &
     a\end{smallmatrix}) : a\neq 0, a\in \mathbb{R} \right\}$ with the
     matrix multiplication for $\mathbb{R}^{2\times2}$ matrices.
     
* Solutions
  1. 
     1) Not possible, see the argument for exercise 5.
     2) Possible, try to draw it.  First draw $K_4$ (the will be the
        vertices with degrees $6, 5, 5, 5$), and connect the remaining
        edges from the $6$ degree vertex to the last three vertices.
        The rest is up to you!
     3) Not possible, $\sum_{v\in V}d(v)$ is odd, see lectures.
     4) Not possible, see exercise 2 in p1-graphs-dm2.pdf.
  2. See exercise 14.
  3. See exercise 24.
